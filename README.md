## Single-Page CV
Single-page HTML CV to showcase your career history using semantic HTML only.

Project URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv

### Overview
This project demonstrates how to structure a clean, semantic, single-page CV in pure HTML. Styling is intentionally deferred to a later project so you can focus on document structure, accessibility, and metadata (SEO/OG).

### Files
- `index.html`: Contains semantic sections for header, skills, education, experience, and footer, plus essential SEO, Open Graph, and favicon links.

### Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Replace placeholder content (name, title, contact info, dates, companies, achievements) with your own.

### Customize Metadata
- SEO (inside `<head>`):
  - Update `<title>`, `meta[name="description"]`, `meta[name="author"]`, and `link[rel="canonical"]`.
- Open Graph (inside `<head>`):
  - Update `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, and `og:image` to valid values you control.
- Favicon (inside `<head>`):
  - Provide files at the project root or adjust paths:
    - `/favicon.ico`
    - `/icon.svg`
    - `/apple-touch-icon.png`

### Submission Checklist
- Semantically correct HTML structure.
- Single-page layout with sections for education, skills, and career history.
- SEO meta tags in the head section.
- OG tags for better social media sharing.
- A favicon linked in the head section.
